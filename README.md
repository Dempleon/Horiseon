# Horiseon landing page
This project is the landing page for Horiseon Social Solutions Services. I am tasked with adding semantic elements, addressing accessibility issues, and cleaning up and stylesheet.

## Project Description
People with disabilities may find it hard to navigate and interact with webpages. To ensure the website is assisible for all, images must have alt attributes.

When working with other developers it is important to add semantic HTML tags to allow others to gain a better understading of the function and structure of a webpage.

In order to present well written code, redundancies and unneeded extra code are editted and consolidated.

## Deployment
This project is deployed through [Github pages](https://dempleon.github.io/Horiseon/). 

## Developer notes
There are a few things I learned through working with this project:
-how links work in the nav bar to navigate to a different section of the page
-css class selectors, element selectors
-the importance of alt attributes to a webpage
