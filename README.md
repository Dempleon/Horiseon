Horiseon Social Solutions Services webapp

## Project Description
People with disabilities may find it hard to navigate and interact with webpages. To ensure the website is assisible for all, images must have alt attributes.
When working with other developers it is important to add semantic HTML tags to allow others to gain a better understading of the function of a webpage.
